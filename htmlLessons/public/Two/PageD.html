<div id="div1">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing
and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
Ipsum.</div>

<div>It is a long established fact that a reader will be
distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its
layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many
web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected
humour and the like).<p>  jack and jim</p></div>
